
Module 6 

Part 1: WeatherPy Instructions

In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
* Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
* Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship


Part 2: VacationPy Instructions

In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
